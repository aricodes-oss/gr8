# gr8 - a Chip-8 emulator

A small [Chip-8 emulator](http://devernay.free.fr/hacks/chip8/C8TECH10.HTM) written in Go. Proper README to come later, but for now -

## Running

```go run main.go <path_to_rom_file>```

For convenience I have included the 8 roms from [Timendus' chip8-test-suite](https://github.com/Timendus/chip8-test-suite) in the `roms/` directory.
